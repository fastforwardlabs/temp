						<p>Beauty is
    in the eye of the beholder, and it seems all the fitness influencers on
    Instagram have triggered a cultural shift.</p>
<p>The University of
    Missouri-Kansas City <a
    href="https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/s-tii012518.php">asked
    78 female undergraduate students</a> to rate the winners of the Miss USA
    beauty pageant, and the researchers discovered that women with toned or
    muscular figures are now seen as sexier as women who are very
    thin.</p>
<p>The students were asked to study photos of the women who
    were crowned Miss USA between 1999 and 2013 and rate them according to
    how muscular, thin and attractive they were.</p>
<p>The study found more
    of the recent winners were muscular and toned rather than thin, which
    showed that attitudes toward physical beauty have shifted.</p>
<p>Head
    researcher Frances Bozsik published the study&#x2019;s findings in the
    journal Sex Roles, explaining: &#x201C;There is a shift in the thin ideal
    female figure to one that now includes the appearance of physical fitness
    via muscularity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She added that this was connected to the
    explosion of &#x201C;fitspo&#x201D; on social media
    channels.</p>
<p>Frances also noted that both muscularity and thinness
    were commonly found among female celebrities.</p>
<p>Referring to sites
    such as Instagram, Tumblr and Pinterest, she explained how being able to
    curate collections of fit and healthy idols can also encourage eating
    disorders.</p>
<p>She said: &#x201C;These websites allow individuals to
    collect images of women with whom they identify or admire, essentially
    allowing them to cultivate their own media repertoire of highly salient
    thin and fit media.</p>
<p>&#x2018;This process of selecting preferred
    images and then narrowing the media focus by placing these images on
    their &#x2018;boards&#x2019; may inadvertently increase the risk of
    developing higher levels of body dissatisfaction, as well as subsequent
    disordered-eating behaviors that are linked to it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A
    second study carried out by the university saw 64 students presented with
    pictures of 14 different women.</p>
<p>Each shot was paired up to show
    the woman with and without muscle definition &#x2014; a combination that
    saw the pictures both deemed equally attractive.</p>
<p>But when one of
    the photos was left untouched, the results showed that the subjects found
    the more muscular version more
    attractive.</p>
